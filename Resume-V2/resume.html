                <p>Hey! I'm Finn Lancaster, a website designer and High School Student in the state of Florida, USA. I started out with programming as a way express my creativity, and quickly grew to love it! Right now, I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, am proficient in Python and Java, and am currently learning PHP and SQL. I also like to "level-up" my developing skills by volunteering at Non-Profit Organizations. See my latest work for ARC Animal Rescue at <a href="http://arcanimalrescue.com/">arcanimalrescue.com</a>!

As I have started looking at colleges, I have been working on building an online presence by contributing to various websites. Compiled below is a list of places I can be found:<br><br>

                <h3 class="blog-title" id="h04">Why I decided to use Django over Node.js, and then switch back within a month</h3>
                <h3 class="blog-subheading">May, 2021</h3>
                <p>
                    Many of you may (and should) be aware of the growing trend of Node.js in web-based applications as a back-end, server, or for REST API’s, and may also know about the Python library Django. In April, I decided to stop Node in favour of Django, and quickly grew to love the structured feel of it and python integration. 
	For those of you not familiar with Django, a quick overview of it can be found at https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/. In sum, Django’s handling of authentication, deployment, RSS feeds, etc, makes it both extremely fast and scaleable. For example, the simple django-admin startproject mysite will generate a folder called mysite with python files containing editable url schemes, admin accounts, and more! Django is based upon small portions of a site, called apps, which can be added to the site as separate url pages, and generated with the command django-admin startapp myapp. 
	Node.js, by contrast, is more flexible in terms of syntax, which may make it easier to write, but can also make your code messy and unorganized, and your application thus slower. While Node doesn’t have a built-in authentication system, it is relatively simple to find a library for it, such as PassportJS (http://www.passportjs.org/). Node is more dependent on the developer for setup, relying on the programmer’s knowledge of the language to do the necessary installs and require what is needed, not exactly unreasonable for a JavaScript-based language (JS is the most popular programming language as of 2020 | https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/blog/most-in-demand-programming-languages/). 

	So why exactly did I switch, if Django had so many powerful features? 
The answer to this, the reason I went-back to Node.js was familiarity, Django install issues, and both languages active base users. 
	To touch briefly on each of these, I was already comfortable with Node and JavaScript. I had worked with both in my Finniky On Node project and CommCMD repo. Django, on the other hand, was python-based, a language that I could write, but was not as skilled in. Furthermore, being a true “JavaScript Junkie,” I respect the flexibile-nature of JS, something that I felt Django just couldn’t give with its rigid syntax and standards. 
	Next, I found Django hard to set-up on my laptop, with Linux, Python, and Django all being extremely buggy. In the constant stream of errors I encountered, first I wrestled with the Python2/3 Linux issues, and then PIP bugs, and then finally the Django-admin command having to be scrapped in-favour of python3 -m django (https://stackoverflow.com/a/43638992) because of PATH related issues. Django is made exclusively for Windows-users, I felt, as many of its commands and installation paths fit perfectly into the WindowOS, and felt faulty and errorous when applied to Linux. For my more python-savvy readers, these errors might seem like a walk-in-the-park to solve, but for me these fixes were the effort of three consecutive days.
	Finally, on a partially-related topic to Django’s buggy nature, I found that its user-base was small, and getting help for atypical errors on the web was few-and-far between. For example, Django has a total of 266,955 questions on StackOverflow, compared to Node.js’ 388,458, which is a huge difference for someone used to searching a few keywords and finding a relevant answer (I.e. JS on StackOverflow). 
	In conclusion, both Django and Node.js are large server-side languages in modern web-development, with each bringing their own benefits and shortcomings to the table. For me, I switched back to Node.js in May of 2021 because of my familiarity with it, its cross-platform nature, and because of its active user-base. While each of these languages is experiencing massive growth in popularity, both for their own good reasons, Node.js was just too feature-rich for me to move-on from. Overall, I would highly recommend either of these languages to any interested programmers out there, but put an emphasis on the look for Node developers in the workforce currently.
